	http://bugzilla.remotesensing.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1245

2006-06-26  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam@pobox.com>

	* geo_new.c: If the ascii parameters list is too short for the declared
	  size of an ascii parameter, but it doesn't start off the end of the
          available string then just trim the length.  This is to make the
          ESRI sample data file 34105h2.tif work properly.  I wish we had
          a way of issuing warnings!

==============================================================================

	which happen to straddle the end of the message buffer when expanded
	with escape characters.  (as reported by Leica - not in bugzilla).

2003-09-23  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam@pobox.com>

	* geo_print.c: fixed PrintKey() to work for constant names longer
	than the message buffer.  
	http://bugzilla.remotesensing.org/show_bug.cgi?id=399

	* geo_new.c: various hacks so that with improperly terminated ascii
	parameters such as "34737 (0x87b1) ASCII (2) 9<Mercator\0>" will 
	still work.  eg. 1164-0.tif

	call for applications to force all CSV files to be de-cached.

	* cpl_serv.h: renamed lots of CPL functions with gt prefixes using
	macros. 

2003-01-07  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam@pobox.com>

	* configure.in: fixed some stuff with last changes.  The --with-libtiff
	option can now be used to give a base directory with libtiff installed
	into /include and /lib directories under that.

2003-01-02  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam@pobox.com>

	* configure.in: Remove logic to insert /usr/local/ in include and lib
	path.  Remove configure switch for in-code EPSG tables since that 
	option is broken for now.

2002-12-01  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam@pobox.com>

	* cpl_csv.c: rewritten to support in memory caching of tables, and
	fast searches. 

	* geo_extra.c: tweaked to favor fixed EPSG codes for Kentucky North
	(NAD83), and Tennesse (NAD27).  The original entries have incorrect
	values. Also modified epsg_pcs.inc and epsg_proj.inc.

	geo_write.c: Rainer Wiesenfarth (wiesi at ngi dot de) submitted
	patches to support deletion, and changes to ascii tags.  To accomplish
	this the ASCII tags are now allocated dynamically.  The
	GTIFF_ASCIIPARAMS are split up when read, and recombined when written.

2002-09-21  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam@pobox.com>

	* geo_names.c: added support for VerticalUnitsGeoKey as per bug 203.

2002-07-19  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam@pobox.com>

	* cpl_csv.h, cpl_serv.h, cpl_csv.c, cpl_csv_incode.c, geo_normalize.c:
	Removed the cpl_csv.h file, and merged it into cpl_serv.h.  Modified
	all modules including cpl_csv.h to include cpl_serv.h instead.  This
	is to avoid a conflict with the cpl_csv.h in GDAL.

2002-05-31  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam@pobox.com>

	* geo_print.c: modified to using backslash escaping for backslashes,
	and newlines handle newlines in citations (as occur in Erdas generated
	files, for instance).  Also resolved some problems with processing
	long string values though very long strings will still blow up
	GTIFImport().

	http://bugzilla.remotesensing.org/show_bug.cgi?id=139

2002-02-25  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam@pobox.com>

	* configure.in: added setting of EXEEXT macro - allow .exe files on
	Cygwin.

	* libxtiff/xtiff.c: Rewrote to use new "custom field" interface to
	libtiff (requires libtiff 3.6.x).   Removed xtiffiop.h.  No longer
	a dependence on private libtiff include files.

2002-02-12  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam@pobox.com>

	* Prepare 1.1.5 release.

	* geo_normalize.c: call CSVDeaccess() at end of GTIFPrintDefn() so that
	listgeo has closed all file handles by the end. 

2001-11-28  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam@pobox.com>

	* geo_trans.c: fixed memory leak of transform in GTIFPCSToImage()
	as reported by Ng Lay Keow (Nicole).

	http://bugzilla.remotesensing.org/show_bug.cgi?id=29

2000-12-05  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam@pobox.com>

	* Added cassini support in geotiff_proj4.c.

	* modified geotiff_proj4.c to use +R_A to use spherical radius
	of equal area, similar to other systems like GCTP for the
	Miller Cylindrical and VanDerGrinten.  Should also do for any
	other spherical projections as identified.

2000-11-30  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam@pobox.com>

	* Fixed Makefile.in to install all the .inc files with the include
	files.

2000-11-24  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam@pobox.com>

	* Added configure/makefile logic to build a shared library, 
	currently libgeotiff.so.1.1.5, and intall it with appropriate links.

	* Modified configure to use --with-libtiff, and to ignore TIFF_HOME.
	Now it is preferred to use an installed libtiff instead of one sitting
	in a build directory.  

	* Added libtiff_private directory with required libtiff include
	files, to make it easier to build libgeotiff if only the standard
	libtiff development environment was installed.

2000-11-23  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam@pobox.com>

	* Based loosely on suggestions from Curt Mills, I have reworked
	the configure.in logic for PROJ.4.  I add -I/usr/local/include to 
	CFLAGS and -L/usr/local/lib to LIBS right off the start so /usr/local
	is included in the default search path.  The user no longer 
	specifies the PROJ_HOME environment variable, and instead uses
	the --with-proj configure switch.  Updated notes for building 
	PROJ_HOME set in README.

2000-10-13  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerda@cs46980-c>

	* Added EquidistantConic support in PROJ.4 translation.

	* Fixed order of parameters for LCC when read directly from a 
	file to match that when read from EPSG tables.  This is now
	always: 0-NatOriginLat, 1-NatOriginLong, 2-StdParallel1, 3-StdParallel2
	This change is only in geo_normalize.c.

2000-09-29  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerda@cs46980-c>

	* Fixed bug in CPLReadLine() that primarily affects windows, and
	SunOS 4.x.  Bug fix courtesy of shumilin@scanex.ru.

2000-09-15  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerda@cs46980-c>

	* Added the -proj4 option to listgeo to report it's selected
	PROJ.4 string.

	* Fixed order of parameters for LCC 2SP.  When parameters
	were read from EPSG CSV files the standard parallels and origin
	were mixed up.  This affects alot of state plane zones!

==============================================================================

2000-08-22  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerda@cs46980-c>

	* Prepare 1.1.3 release.

	* Added install target to makefile.  Defaults to /usr/local/...

Wed Sep 15 10:19:34 1999  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerda@gdal.velocet.ca>

	* CT_TransvMercator_SouthOriented now CT_TransvMercator_SouthOrientated
	  to match EPSG.  SouthOriented name remains as an alias.

	* Fixed serious bug in geo_normalize.c with translation of
	DD.MMSSsss values.  Return value was seriously off if any 
	fraction of a second was included in the string.

Tue Sep  7 15:57:47 1999  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerda@gdal.velocet.ca>

	* Fixed count/tiepoint_count mixup in GTIFPCSToImage().  Thanks
