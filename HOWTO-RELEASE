	Preparing a libgeotiff Release
	==============================

 1) Update the VERSION_MAJOR/MINOR/POINT information in configure.in.

 2) Update the LIBGEOTIFF_VERSION macro in geotiff.h.

 3) Add a note to the ChangeLog that a new release is being issued, and what
    the release number is.

 4) Tag the release with a command like "cvs tag libgeotiff_1_1_4" from the
    libgeotiff directory.

 5) Prepare a zip and tar.gz file using a command like "mkdist.sh 1.1.5" 
    from within the geotiff/libgeotiff directory. 

 6) Test build and install on at least one Unix platform.  Test build on a
    Windows system.

 7) The resulting files (eg. libgeotiff-1.1.5.tar.gz and libgeotiff115.zip) 
    should be copied to the distribution directory (geotiff/libgeotiff on 
    ftp.remotesensing.org).  Update the README file in that directory to 
    indicate the new current release.

 8) Build binary distributions of libgeotiff, and utilities for various
    Unix platforms (usually Linux, Solaris and IRIX).  This can be accomplished
    using a command like "mkbindist.sh 1.1.5 linux -install".  The -install
    option only works if you have scp locally, and a matching account on 
    remotesensing.org.

 9) Build binary distribution for Windows.  Normally prepared by downloading
    the last distribution, and overlaying the most recent .exe files, and 
    csv files over the ones from the last distribution, and renaming things
    based on the version number.

10) Announce on GeoTIFF mailing list: geotiff@lists.maptools.org
    Include a summary of the ChangeLog items for the most recent release.

11) Update entry at http://www.freshmeat.net/projects/libgeotiff

12) Update html/geotiff.html to point to most recent release, including
    the most recent release version number.
