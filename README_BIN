	libgeotiff Binary Distribution for Unix
	---------------------------------------

This tree contains a binary distribution of libgeotiff, and related
utilities (listgeo, and geotifcp) for a Unix platform (as indicated in 
the distribution filename).  

The distribution should consist of:

README: this file
bin/listgeo: utility program
bin/geotifcp: utility program
lib/libgeotiff.a: static library for libgeotiff, applications also have
                  to link against libtiff.
lib/libgeotiff-$VERSION.so: Shared library version of the above.
lib/libgeotiff.so: link to the specific shared library.
include: The include files for libgeotiff.
share/epsg_csv: The EPSG CSV files used to decompose projection systems.

This distribution is intended to be suitable to untar directly under
/usr/local or /usr to give a rough equivelent to having done a "make install" 
from the libgeotiff source, though this README should be removed.

If this distribution is not installed under /usr/local, it will likely be
necessary to define the GEOTIFF_CSV environment variable to point at
the share/epsg_csv directory.  For reporting of lat/long equivelents of
